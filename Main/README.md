# Note-Taking-App

## description

This is a note taking application using express.js on the back end to save and retrieve note data from a JSON file. This application will let users write down notes to ensure that they don't forget tasks which they need to do. It is hosted on heroku to ensure that the server works. When you click on items in the left hand column, it will display them in the note section on the right so you can read their text.
